The RxGORM REST Client projects aims to implement a non-blocking REST client using RxJava, RxNetty and the RxGORM API. RxGORM is a Object mapping technology that has implementations for MongoDB and other databases. In fact RxGORM REST Client uses the same Object to document encoding engine and RxGORM for MongoDB resulting in high performance encoding and decoding of JSON documents from REST web services.

NOTE: Currently RxGORM REST Client only supports JSON responses and XML support is not planned at this time.

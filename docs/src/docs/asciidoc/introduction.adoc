The RxGORM for REST project aims to implement a non-blocking REST client using RxJava, RxNetty and the RxGORM API. RxGORM is an Object mapping technology that has implementations for MongoDB and other databases. In fact RxGORM for REST uses the same Object-to-Document encoding engine used in RxGORM for MongoDB, resulting in high performance encoding and decoding of JSON documents from REST web services.

NOTE: Currently RxGORM REST Client only supports JSON responses and XML support is not planned at this time.

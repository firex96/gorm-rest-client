With a single host configuration RxGORM for REST will create a connection pool for that single host.

The connection pool is defined by a https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxNetty/blob/0.5.x/rxnetty-common/src/main/java/io/reactivex/netty/client/pool/PoolConfig.java[io.reactivex.netty.client.pool.PoolConfig] instance.

The properties of this instance can configured via the `grails.gorm.rest.pool.options` property. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
grails:
    gorm:
        rest:
            host: http://localhost:8080
            pool:
                options:
                    maxConnections: 20

RxGORM for REST includes a low level client in the form of the link:../api/grails/http/client/RxHttpClientBuilder.html[RxHttpClientBuilder] class that can be used to fulfill use cases that don't warrant the creation of a domain class.

The most simple use case for obtaining content can be seen below:

[source,groovy]
import grails.http.client.*
...
RxHttpClientBuilder client = new RxHttpClientBuilder()
Observable<RxHttpClientBuilder> p = client.post("https://localhost:8080/foo/bar") {
    contentType 'application/json'
    json {
        title "Ping"
    }
}
p.toJson().subscribe { Object json ->
    assert json.title == 'Pong'
}

If you are using the Grails plugin then you do not need to instantiate a new instance and can instead just autowire the existing instance into your controller:

[source,groovy]
@Autowired
RxHttpClientBuilder httpClient

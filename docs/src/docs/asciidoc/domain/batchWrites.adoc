You can perform multiple HTTP write operations (`POST` or `DELETE` etc.) by using either the `saveAll` or `deleteAll` methods:


[source,groovy]
----
// multiple POST operations
Observable observable = Book.saveAll(
    new Book(title:"The Stand"),
    new Book(title:"The Shining")
)

// multiple DELETE operations
Observable observable = Book.deleteAll(
    book1,
    book2
)
----

These methods will return an `Observable` that only completes when all the operations have been successful.

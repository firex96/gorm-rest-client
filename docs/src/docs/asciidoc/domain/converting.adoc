You can convert any domain instance to a JSON string with to `toJson()` method:

[source,groovy]
----
Book book = new Book(title:"The Stand")
println book.toJson()
----

You can also pass a `java.io.Writer` to the method if you wish to write the JSON to a specify target writer:

[source,groovy]
----
Book book = new Book(title:"The Stand")
StringWriter writer = new StringWriter()
book.toJson(writer)
println writer.toString()
----

You can read an instance from JSON using the `fromJson` static method:

[source,groovy]
----
String json = ...
Book book = Book.fromJson(json)
----

A variation of the method accepts a `java.io.Reader` to read JSON from an alternate source:

[source,groovy]
----
Reader jsonReader = ...
Book book = Book.fromJson(jsonReader)
----

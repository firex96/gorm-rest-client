Each method that issues an HTTP request also accepts a `Closure` which delegates to the link:../api/grails/http/client/builder/HttpClientRequestBuilder.html[HttpClientRequestBuilder] class and allows customization of the outgoing request. For example:

[source,groovy]
----
import static grails.http.HttpHeader.*

Observable<Book> observable = new Book(title: "The Stand").save {
    header ACCEPT_CHARSET, "UTF-8"
}
----

The above example adds an additional `ACCEPT_CHARSET` header to the request. The same same technique can be used with static methods:

[source,groovy]
----
import static grails.http.HttpHeader.*

Observable<Book> observable = Book.get(1) {
    header ACCEPT_VERSION, "v1.0.0"
}
----

Another common use case is to add `BASIC` auth credentials:

[source,groovy]
----
Observable<Book> observable = Book.get(1) {
    auth "myusername", "mypassword"
}
----

Only bidirectional many ended associations are supported. To define an association you can use the `hasMany` syntax:

[source,groovy]
----
package example

import grails.gorm.rx.rest.*

class Book implements RxRestEntity<Book> {
    String title

    static hasMany = [authors:Author]
}

class Author implements RxRestEntity<Author> {
    String name
    static belongsTo = [book:Book]
}
----

In this case by default a <<uriTemplates,URI template>> of `/book/{book}/authors` will be created as it is assumed that the `/book` resource wholly owns the `authors` and therefore it is nested within it. You can alter how the URI maps using the `mapping` block:


[source,groovy]
----
package example

import grails.gorm.rx.rest.*

class Book implements RxRestEntity<Book> {
    String title

    static hasMany = [authors:Author]

    static mapping = {
        authors '/books/{book}/info/authors'
    }
}
----

TIP: Within the <<uriTemplates,URI Template>> for the association you can include any properties of the `Book` class.


When an entity is retrieved all many ended associations are lazy by default and return an instance of link:../api/grails/gorm/rx/collection/RxPersistentCollection.html[RxPersistentCollection] which allows you to subscribe to the collection to load it in a non-blocking manner:


[source,groovy]
----
Book.get(1).subscribe { Book book ->
    book.authors.subscribe { Author author ->
        println "got author $author.name"
    }
}
